Lulzchatbot is a chatbot that is intended to impress your friends. Again, since Peter Answers is too mainstream, this a different version, since saying a Petition is quite Suspicious so let us just do a different method of answer hiding.

Keyboard Dexterity is a must when using this application. Once you are caught with this "prank", "trolling" or "whatever", it is now your concern.

Here is how to use.

1.) Enter your Question and put the question mark at the bottom
2.) You will see that a button is highlighted after pressing the question mark, you must be typing your supposed answer FAST(Make sure what you type is in correct spelling to avoid suspicion).
3.) Press the send button and voila.

Happy Trolling
